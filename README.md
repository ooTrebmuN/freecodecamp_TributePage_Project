# freecodecamp_TributePage_Project

We All Bleed The Same Blood is a tribute page for Veterans of this great nation. 
It is to remind us all that no matter your race, gender or religious beliefs we all fight for Freedom.

We are all family.

This project is being started due to my interest in wanting to learn to code. I found FreeCodeCamp while searching the interwebz for a way
to learn a language. I didn't know which one I wanted to learn, I started with Python, I didn't get far before hearing about FreeCodeCamp.
I loved the idea of being able to learn and later on also being able to give back to those that need it. If you have never heard of them,
I recommend checking them out. After a pre-determined amount of learning hours, you have the option to actually help work on projects for
non-profit organizations.
