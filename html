When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, the Continental Navy was disestablished, and with it, the Continental Marines. The Corps was re-established on 11 July 1798, when the "act for establishing and organizing a Marine Corps" was signed by President John Adams.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_birthday_ball" target="blank"> Reference 1..</a> </br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101007205958/http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Docs_Speeches/Establishingamarinecorps.htm" target="blank"> Reference 2.. </a></br></br>  <b>The United States Navy (USN)</b></br>13 October 1775 Congress called for the construction of a half-dozen frigates.

The Coast Guard is technically part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since 2002, before that it was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and before that under the Department of the Treasury yet still listed as a branch of the United States Armed Forces, and I believe they deserve to be. If anyone is protecting America it's the Coast Guard. They are right here on our shores keeping us and our Maritime community safe.</br><a href="www.military.com/coast-guard-birthday" target="blank"> Reference 1..</a></br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard" target="blank"> Reference 2..</a></br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformed_services_of_the_United_States" target="blank"> Reference 3..</a></br></ul>    </br><hr color="black"></br>    <div align=center><img class="thick-black-border" src="http://www.picturethisongranite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bonita-spring-fallen-soldiers-memorial-500x500.jpg"></div>  </p><h2 class="white-text" align=center>Sometimes, that isn't always the case...</h2><p><div ending-div><div class="box1">  There are too many Veterans coming home from current conflicts who aren't getting the help they need. Recent studies done by the Veterans Affairs found that suicide percentages are higher amount Veterans than the civilian population.  Some say its due to <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml" target="blank">PTSD</a> or <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tbi/tbi.htm" target="blank">TBI</a> but the report states these aren't just Veterans from current conflicts. Many are above 50 years of age. The VA is putting a lot of effort into trying to keep our Heroes here and well. I think we can do our part just as human beings. We shouldn't just have one day a year to say thank you. We should encourage our young to thank our Veterans and Service members every chance they get. I still do it. They always say thank you and you can see that chest puff out a bit after that. I know mine does. It reminds me people still care that I made sacrifices. Maybe not as much as others, but I did sign that blank check because I believe in this country and in Freedom.
